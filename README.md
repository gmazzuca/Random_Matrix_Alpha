# Random_Matrix_Alpha
Simulation of the mean density of states for the Gaussian, Laguerre e Jacobi alpha ensemble. 

The code just simulate the eigenvalues' distribution of the alpha ensembles, for a reference regardin the alpha ensemble look at [1]

The python code Gaussian_fix.py simulate the distribution for the Gaussian alpha ensemble.
The python code Laguerre_fix.py simulate the distribution for the Laguerre alpha ensemble.
The python code Jacobi_fix.py simulate the distribution for the Jacobi alpha ensemble.

New:
Simulation of the mean density of states for the Antisymmetric Gaussian beta ensemble in the high temperature regime, for a definition see [2].

The python code Antisym_Gaussian_ht.py simulate the eigenvalue distribution for the Antisymmetric Gaussian beta ensemble in the high temperature regime.
